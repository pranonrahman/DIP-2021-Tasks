# DIP-2021-Tasks (Ongoing)

## Overview 

This repository contains my codes of lab tasks of CSE 4741 (Digital Image Processing) of year 2021.  All the codes were added to this repository after the deadline for submitting the code is over. A brief description along with documentation is added with the code. Details of each file is given below:

| File Name  | Details (Tasks)    |
|--|--|
| DIP_Lab_01_170041014 | 1. Thresholding Operation 2. Histogram Generation  |
| DIP_Lab_02_170041014 | 1.  Log Transformation <br>  2. Power-law Transformation. <br> 3. Global Histogram Equalization on gray-scale images.<br> 4. Local Histogram Equalization (LHE) on gray scale images.  |
| DIP_Lab_03_170041014 | 1. Linear Filter <br> 2. Non-Linear Filter <br> 3. Image Sharpening   |
| DIP_Lab_04_170041014 | 1. Color Image Processing <br> -- Negative Transformation <br> -- GHE <br> -- Filtering <br> -- Noise Removal   |
| DIP_Lab_05_170041014 | **Task 1**. Implement the morphological Dilation and Erosion on Binary images. Show the effects of repeated applications of both Dilation and Erosion. <br> *Note:* You cannot use built-in libraries. <br> **Task 2**. Complete the solutions to exercise ![$9.36$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=9.36&mode=inline) of Chapter ![$09$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=09&mode=inline) (Textbook) \ A preprocessing step in an application of microscopy is concerned with the issue of isolating individual round particles from similar particles that overlap in groups of two or more particles (see following image). Assuming that all particles are of the same size, propose a morphological algorithm that produces three images consisting respectively of <br> (a) Only of particles that have merged with the boundary of the image. <br>(b) Only overlapping particles. <br> (c) Only nonoverlapping particles.  <br>**Task 3**.Complete the solutions to exercise ![$9.34$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=9.34&mode=inline) of Chapter ![$09$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=09&mode=inline) (Textbook) \ Consider the image given, which shows a region of small circles enclosed by a region of larger circles. Locate the boundary between those distinct texture regions.  <br> **Task 4**. Granulometry is a field that deals with determining the size distribution of particles in an image. Determine the sizes of granules in Fig. 9.41(a) which is an image of wood dowel plugs of two dominant sizes. Apply smoothing on the given image before you apply the Opening operations with circular SEs of variables sizes. |
